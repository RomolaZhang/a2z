          <textarea id = "textinput">It is said that no matter how jumbled the letters in a word are, the human brain is able to recognize the word as long as the first and last letters are in the right place. For me, though the reading speed may be slow, it's almost effortless to read a paragraph in jumbled letters. I guess this is because when we look at a word, we do not get its meaning by reading its letters orderly, but try to perceive it as a whole. I believe that there's similarity in the concept of closure in design, about how human brains tend to imaginarily fill up the blank space to make sense of things. Try playing with jumbled letters here!</textarea>
